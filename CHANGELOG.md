### Features

- Added the `verbose` option to object serializer to create consistent yet verbose output (see [#30](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/30)).

## [2.1.7] - 2020-07-09

### Bug Fixes

- Prevented object converter from grouping attributes into element content (see [#29](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/29)).

## [2.1.6] - 2020-07-02

### Bug Fixes

- Added minified browser bundle from transpiled ES5 code so that the library can be used on old browsers (see [#28](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/28)). Note that `Proxy` and `Reflect` polyfills are required to use the library on IE 11.

## [2.1.5] - 2020-06-18

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where carriage return characters (`'\r'`) were escaped in text and attribute contents (see [#24](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/24)).

## [2.1.3] - 2020-06-11

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where child nodes did not inherit the parent namespace (see [#18](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/18)).
- Fixed a bug where falsy values passed as node contents caused missing nodes (see [#21](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/21)).

## [2.1.2] - 2020-04-09

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where the `noDoubleEncoding` flag kept named entities other than [those specified in the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-predefined-ent) (see [#16](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/16)).

## [2.1.1] - 2020-04-01

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where calling `end` on a document fragment node would serialize the fragment's owner document not the fragment itself.

## [2.1.0] - 2020-03-31

### Features

- Added the `noDoubleEncoding` option to prevent html entities from being re-encoded when serialized (see [#15](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/15)).

## [2.0.0] - 2020-03-30

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed namespace inheritance logic, so that a preferred prefix is not retrieved from a parent element if the element has no prefix and its namespace matches the default namespace declaration (see: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/16703).
- Namespace declaration attributes from JS objects are now applied correctly to their parent elements (see [#13](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/13)).

### Features

- Narrowed return value types of functions for better intellisense support with TypeScript (see [#14](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/14)).
- Added `invalidCharReplacement` option to sanitize input strings by replacing invalid characters (see [#12](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/12)). The option has no defaults and must be configured by the user.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Removed `inheritNS` options (see [#1](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/1), [#6](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/6) and [#13](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/13)). Element nodes now inherit namespaces from their parent element nodes by default. To reset the default namespace declaration create an `"xmlns"` attribute with an empty value (`""`) as in the DOM.

## [1.8.1] - 2020-03-27

### Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes

### Features

- Added JS object and XML string parser to callback API functions.
- Added tree depth to collection function callbacks.

## [1.4.3] - 2020-03-03

### Bug Fixes

- `keepNullNodes` and `keepNullAttributes` flags now properly keep `null` **and** `undefined` values (see [#5](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/5)). Without these flags, `null` **and** `undefined` will be silently skipped.

## [1.4.2] - 2020-03-02

### Bug Fixes

- Added `types` to `package.json` to help IDEs infer types (see [#4](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/4)).

## [1.4.1] - 2020-02-28

### Bug Fixes

- Prevented child element namespaces to be inherited from their parent elements (see [#1](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder2/issues/1)).
- Fixed JS object parser to allow namespaces for both element nodes and attributes with the `{ "prefix:name@ns": {} }` notation.

## [1.1.1] - 2020-02-13

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `width` option to work in pretty-printing mode to wrap attributes.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-02-12
